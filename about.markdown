# What is Slack?

Slack is a collaboration hub that enables real-time communications and connections in a searchable platform for real-time messaging, content sharing, learning, and more. RIT Enterprise Slack allows teams within RIT to have separate, but connected, workspaces across the university.

# Why Use It?

### Reduce Email Overload
Many announcements and requests can go through Slack rather than mailing lists, which allows people to post replies without automatically notifying everyone (You can even email the information to the Slack channel!)

Meeting agendas and minutes could go to a "Faculty Meetings" channel, which allos comments to be added as replies to the agenda

Topic-focused channels can be used to allow disucssion of items that some but not all faculty are interested in, instead of having to either use the whole faculty mailing list, or remember who put in the email recipient list (e.g. the capstone discussion). If someone joins the channel later, it's easy for them to skim or serach the existing posts to get caught up

Questions that need a quick answer can be a simple Slack DM. (e.g. messaging a faculty member to remind them to pick up something from the office, or post their office hours)

### Slack vs Email
In comparison to email, Slack has a lot of features that email cannot do, including:
*   Easier searching capability
*   Setting remindser on individual messages (instead of letting your email inbox pile up with things that you know you need to respond to later)
* Has a 'Remind Me About This Later' functionality to remind you about certain messages
* Inegration with Google Docs, making it less necessary to send attachments
* Quick video conferencing, including Zoom integration, if a channel thread or a DM becomes a "can we have a quick conversation about this?"
* Creating workspaces or channels for cross-unit groups -- for instance a MAGIC research group that might have participants from multiple departments
